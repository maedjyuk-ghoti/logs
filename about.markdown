## Welcome
Welcome to the logs. The intent is for this to be a collection of logs that are relevant to me. They may be logs of books read or waiting, milestones that have been reached or aimed towards, or musings on idle thoughts. There may be frequent updates to some logs, while others will necessarily be fairly static.

## About Me
My name is Ben Green. I took a roundabout path through music at Florida State University before graduating from Clemson University with a degree in Computer Science. My day job is finding increasingly silly ways to create applications for Android. Outside of work, I spend a lot of time playing trombone in community jazz bands, orchestras, and musicals.

## Plans for logs
There are no plans to stick to a certain topic. There are plenty of places for those, and I'm not enough of an authority to write meaningfully about most of them. Expect varied content; especially to start. Hopefully I learn how to tag things appropriately so searching is useful.
