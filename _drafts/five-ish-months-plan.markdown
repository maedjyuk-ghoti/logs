## Background
I've always been terrible at using a planner. In middle school the teachers would check planners to make sure everybody had the right information written down. Mine was always blank. The idea of writing things down made no sense, I'd just remember it all so I wouldn't have to waste time recording for later. This was reinforced when I was forced to write something down and then was able to recall it later without reading the planner.

Back then I didn't understand that writing things down is not admiting a failure. That there are times where your best isn't good enough. It took me until college to see this. It was my private lessons teacher, Bill Haugeberg, who really drove home the point of documenting things. He required that I make a schedule of my day: when I would wake up, practice, eat, study, sleep. Through making that schedule, I realized that writing things down actually reinforced the boundaries between activities and made them more real.

I'm still terrible at writing everything down, but now it's because I write the wrong down the wrong things or don't provide enough context. That is something I can practice and evaluate daily, weekly at the longest. But now seems like a perfectly adequate time to increase this time scale by a smidge. Hence, an X Time Plan.

## X Time Plan
The idea is simple: A `Plan` that takes `X` amount of `Time` units. In this case, `Five-ish Months`.

## Why Five-ish Months?
While I think it's a great time to start a larger scale plan, I don't much like how it works out in relatively. Being finally free of schools, making the start of the plan coincide with the school year seems deflating. As for not aligning with the calendar, it just doesn't feel right. I don't want to be controlled by it, so I won't align with it.

More to the point, it is currently September 12, 2020. Five months will take us to the Beginning of March. Which is a little past my birthday at the end of February. Four months would have been shy as well. But for today only (and because 2021 is not a leap year), it would be 4.5 months to my birthday. I'd also rather push out a deadline before signing up than after.

## The Plan
Alright, enough preamble. Let's get on with it.

### Debt
In December of 2015, I graduated from Clemson University with just under $40 thousand of debt despite having a prepaid college plan that my grandparents had started for me when I was born. One of the things that drives me is the need to be independent in the sense of not _having_ to ask others for help or turning down opportunities because of external weights. I made a pledge to myself that I would get rid of all my debt 5 years after I got my first job. I was able to start my first job out of college working as a developer on February 15th, 2016.

#### Goal
Be debt free by the end of February 2021. I have $11,790.11 to go.

I slacked off paying as much as I could for a while when I was looking for a new job in 2018. And I have not paid any amount towards it during this pandemic, which has not increased the amount owed because all interest was suspended for a time. This is something that can be easily realized. Unless there's a major life change, this should be an easy one to check off.

### Exercise
One thing I have never been is in shape. I have been healthy and able, but never mistaken for strong or fit. It's never been a concern but always a nagging thought. There have never been reasons not to exercise, but I've found plenty of excuses. One of the biggest things for me is the amount of effort required to _start_ the exercise: going to a gym is more effort than exercising at home, riding a bike is more effort than running. And then being discouraged is a huge factor for me. I've never liked crowds or groups, even if they are well meaning.

#### Goal
Run a 5k. I plan to achieve this by using FitBit Coach to regulate sessions 3 times. Because of the Pandemic an official 5k might be out, but running one on my own with a gps tracker as proof should work.

While I love swimming, having grown up in South Florida where swimming was basically mandatory given the amount of water and pool season being 8-10 months of the year. It's much harder to find a swimming pool plus driving there is effort. Running is something that sounds terrible but I've never really tried to do it before. I don't know anything about running. Watching Usain Bolt in the Olympics is the most I've ever seen. Combined with being awful at it, that leaves no basis for comparison which sounds perfect.

### Reading
Philosphy has never been at the top of my list of interests. But the Pandemic (common theme) has brought some things up that leave me mentally wandering around more than usual. The Meditations is a book that I've seen highly regarded as an introduction to Stoicism. And now seems like a great time to learn about it and see if it can help me at all in my life.

#### Goal
Read and discuss Meditations with my friend Josh who happens to have spent a great deal of time reading and discussing writings such as this.

## Wrap-up
3 goals seems rather light, but I figure starting light to get momentum will encourage me to create another `X Time Plan`. There are many other things I want to work on and will probably end up trying, but I won't hold myself accountable for them yet. There are also goals that are impossible to judge because of the dynamics involved. Last, but not least, the plans that cannot be written in public because sharing those might not have the desired/a desirable outcome.
